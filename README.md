# Client-Server

•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The CRUD method stands for create, read, update, and delete. Using widgets helps the user to navigate your programs easier, or that’s the Idea anyway. Remembering that the programs are always updating, therefore making it easier to remember that, you can build your programs to be able to use CRUD effectively.
•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
One step at a time. One moment at a time.  You can also look for other examples to be used online
•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Set up a meeting with the clients and find out what they are looking for, and work to meet their need.
